# CoffeeMaker Quest
C1632 2nd Deliverable

##How to build
All library are included in the lib folder.
If you use Intellij IDEA, just import the whole project.
compile and run CoffeeMaker.java to run the coffeemaker quest game

GameTest, PlayTest, RoomTest and RoomsTest are tests for those java files.
We don't include any public method besides main in CoffeeMaker.java so there is no Test file for it.
